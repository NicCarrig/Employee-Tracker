# Employee-Tracker
## Challenge Week 12 - MySQL Employee Tracker

## Description
This is a command line application used to track and update employees, roles, and departments within a company. When started, the application will give the user the options to view, add, and update the databases containing the lists of employees, roles, and departments and the infomation related to each. When viewing the departments, the user should be able to view the department's ID number and name. When viewing the roles, the user should be able to view the role's ID number, title, salary, and related department. When viewing all employees, the lists of employees' names, titles, salaries, department names, and managers' names should be displayed.
This application uses Node.js and MySQL to accomplish this.

## Requirements
Javascript, Node.js, MySQL, NPM Inquirer, NPM Console Table

## Usage
In order to use this app, you need to first seed the SQL database (run the db, schema, and seeds in that order in the mysql shell). You then need to install the required npm packages using the 'npm i' command in the command line. Then, use the 'npm start' to start the prompts.
